that was the test"
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"i had a friend who used to hold onto mace in her pocket in case some crazy dude pulled this crap. i always wondered if the entire car would have burning eyes if she actually used it, but considering none of those people were likely to actually help, the collateral damage might not be worth taking an assault over."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"i just went through a similar situation last week. just sitting minding my own business when i got punched in the head twice by a couple teenagers. no reason. i’m amazed they did it to me, since i’m 6’ and 225 lbs. also glad they didn’t do it to the woman behind me. also very shaken and with a decent headache. i took note of the train car and time and reported it to septa police. went home and wrote everything down that i could remember. they called me back yesterday for more info, but still waiting to see what else comes out of it. 

sorry it happened to you. report it to the septa police. they gotta get a better handle on this."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"i agree that contacting septa police is probably the best way to address this. i'm sorry you had to experience this! everyone deserves to just get a cheesesteak in peace in this city, damn."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"this sucks, i’m sorry. i was also really confused until i realized that the center city steve’s is closed. before the pandemic, you wouldn’t have needed to get on that train."

tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"please report to septa especially considering their employee did nothing to help you. they probably have footage of the assault. maybe reach out to the news as well, i’m sure they will be interested. i hope you can find some justice. 

i’m so sorry this happened to you. and for the future, i’d strongly recommend not wearing earphones ever when you’re out alone in the city."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"> in fact a couple people move away from me and tell me not to bring my problem over here

how you know this actually occurred in philly."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"you need to have a “fight mentality” here, if you seem stressed it will make you more of a target & people aren’t very helpful. when i was a teenager i was on the train when a man was touching and exposed himself to me. i got up, walking towards him cursing & screaming at the top of my lungs. when the doors opened he ran away. 

always carry some sort of protection. sorry this happened to you buddy."

tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,septa is not the ttc in toronto.  septa is just unkempt and not policed.  the septa staff and police spend all their time at the septakey scanning station and scrolling their own phones.   i seriously felt much safer and certainly much cleaner in mexico city's awesome subway system recently than on the el.
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,i'm so sorry you went through that. we have a lot of mentally ill people wandering the streets.
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,yea unfortunately not much you can do here. i’m inclined to help when someone’s clearly uncomfortable but most aren’t i guess. i think the only “mistake” you made (and it’s not a mistake) but definitely head off this kinda shit as soon as he touched you in the beginning. i think the ignoring it in the beginning might have told the person they could fuck with you. you really did nothing wrong though.
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,contact septa police. there are cameras everywhere. if he swiped the turnstile (doubtful) to get on they’ll have the payment info from that swipe.
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,mace that guy
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"i’m a third-year temple student, and my favorite septa memory so far was when i was sitting on the bsl and some crackhead was wandering up and down all the cars begging - no, more like rudely antagonizing everyone for money. no one was giving him shit and he said something like “y’all n***as are selfish,” and immediately after that the brakes hit and he falls hard, completely onto me. the man slowly gets off of me and then has the nerve to ask me for money. i couldn’t restrain a laugh because the situation was just so absurd.

while i love philly and want to keep living here after i graduate, you can’t help but feel like theres just some sort of toxic, underlying disease that’s making the city sink into such depths of decay and lawlessness these days. the problem is much broader than just septa security, that’s for sure."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"ugh so sorry. i moved here from the toronto area and tbh, i'd never recommend any outsiders/visitors to take septa trains alone."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"not victim blaming but you can't wear headphones and be scrolling through your phone without keeping an eye on what's going on around you in the city. and if somebody starts touching you or even invading your space you need to be loud and clear that they need to fuck off. you need to be aware that area's outside of the usual tourist destinations get rough fast. 

it's head on a swivel, eyes aware, and out aggressive aggressiveness. it's also naive to believe others are going to jump in to help you. it's me, myself, and i in philly (and a lot of other major cities).

sorry for the scare, but take this as a lesson. you didn't get seriously hurt. take the street lesson and run with it."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"i would tweet that dude steve keeley at fox29. stories like this need to get out. of course, you should report this to septa police, as well, but your story and others could help push septa and the city to get ahold of the situation on the el. there's a complete lack of police presence, people are feeling like they're free to do whatever.

side note: i don't wear headphones at fucking all in the city, much less on the el."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"hey there - philly resident (from ontario) reporting in. very sorry to hear this. philly has good things happening, but not this. i’m sorry this happened."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"itt: people happy to normalize assault in public because “it’s philly” and “you gotta have your head on a swivel”. op is a visitor just trying to get from point a to point b, and got a first hand experience of how philly people would rather mind their own business instead of making sure pieces of shit don’t start trouble. only when they were directly affected did they speak up. 

i’d rather go with “city shouldn’t normalize the scum of this city terrorizing people by telling others that they have to think they’re in a warzone when they’re just going about their business”."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"this reminds me of the time 7 or 8 years ago i was on the el near city hall. a guy starts talking shit to someone who looked trans, and the trans person and their friends started making fun of the insulting guys shoes and outfit. 

a guy sitting near me then silently took out a switchblade, opened it, and rested it on his lap. didn't say a word and kept sitting there. 

thankfully this didn't escalate and the asshole got off at the next stop."

tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"you never encountered anything like this in toronto? yeah, i feel for you. there are definitely some predators out there, especially if you look like you’re from out of town. the people on the train are fucked up for not helping you."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"i'm sorry this happened to you. the el (blue line) has become an even worse shithole these past couple of years, and many people who regularly ride it are super numb / used to the crazies. i've been taking septa as my main mode of transportation for the past 20 years, and i feel like i've seen it all. but it's just the past couple of years that i feel like i really have to watch my back, as a smallish female."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"sadly, this is normal in philly and i’m so sorry you had to experience this. 

in the future, *the moment someone invades your personal space you need to make it clear that you want nothing to do with that person*. move away, cuss him out aggressively, *get pissed*. no one will take you seriously if you don’t take you seriously. your first mistake was ignoring the guy using you as an arm rest. it may not be in your character, and that is fine, but in a city like philly… it has to be your character or else things like this will happen. people are scary and weird.

i’m a very soft person in general, typically let people walk over me as long as it doesn’t overstep boundaries (still a problem though lol) however the second i step onto any public transportation in nyc or philly - i’m “pissed”. i’m getting from point a to point b, anyone attempting or *seeming like they are attempting* to get in my way is getting the cold shoulder and is dead to me, or is getting cussed the fuck out.

hope you feel better, op."

tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"not trying to downplay your scenario whatsoever, but if i had to guess i’d say the other passengers probably didn’t do anything bc of how *relatively* often nutbags do that shit. 

regardless, it’s not an easy thing to ignore especially when you’re not familiar with the area. i would definitely suggest taking the first car and sittinf as close to the conductor as possible, it’s usually calmer up that way!

sorry this happened, anyone would be rattled in your shoes. look up the septa safety numbers to dial! local ones as well"
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"reading this comment section has me wondering how i traveled alone on septa into center city for concerts, as a teenage girl, and not have any encounters where i feel threatened or genuinely uncomfortable. and this was in the past few years for extra context now. but now, i ride with my bf whenever and we are working towards getting our drivers licenses"
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"why would u sit with a man using your body for his own purpose while you were in a train in public with people watching? 🤯

also, would you have let someone use you as an arm rest on public transportation in toronto? just in case no one ever told you this: a stranger is not allowed to touch you. anywhere in the world."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,that is honestly so fucking scary and disgusting. sorry that happened to you. i am sad that i have to say this but please buy mace or a taser. don’t let this ever happen again

tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,as an out of towner you shouldn’t even be taking public transportation in this city. this city has been getting sketchy everywhere lately.
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,i am so sorry that happened to you. but i am confused why you decided getting on the el and taking it sooooo far for a cheesesteak? there were so many available options within walking distance.
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"canadian woman here who just found this post…so sorry this happened! i’m a lifelong ttc rider and thought i’ve seen it all. well, i had a similar experience like you just described when i was in los angeles for the marathon a few years ago; took the expo line from santa monica (finish line) back to downtown l.a. was by myself; had no idea at all that i was in way over my head on this train. i wasn’t harassed or hurt, but i definitely was tired/injured and felt like the people around me knew it and could have easily swiped my bag and took off if they wanted to. live and learn i guess.

tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"why the fuck don't they have security / cops on the septa trains? i don't get the apathy of the people who run  this city. they literally don't give a fuck. it's just accepted that people have to feel unsafe in parts of the city. there is no urgency about how dangerous the place is. 

i'm not talking about rounding people up or martial law but fucking common sense like cctv which is actively monitored on public transport so that cops can be waiting at the station, community policing and fucking doing your job. 

 a fine example is temple. my kid is never going there. not because of academia but because it's fucking dangerous. imagine a university in a city that is considered dangerous. it boggles the fucking mind."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"what happened to you is inexcusable and scary, i’m sorry. however, unfortunately stuff can happen in any city, and it happened in philly, which does have a rough reputation. again, not trying to blame op at all bc they didn’t ask for this, however i want to stress how important it is to take the steps to be safe. the first would have been not having headphones in and not paying attention on a subway in a city you are unfamiliar with. the second being letting a random dude use your body as an arm rest. that’s never ok and you gotta speak up for yourself and make it clear you aren’t an easy target fucking around. i’m sorry bystanders were not very helpful, really. unfortunately it’s prob a mix of people being so used to crazy people on public transportation and bystander syndrome."
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,the fact that people find this stuff ok is crazy. i hope you can get by this. i see it a lot. people need to gather themselves and realize assault isn't flattering at all.
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,you should’ve came to this sub before you got on the el (train)! take an uber back and get back safe. i’m glad you are okay. it sounds terrifying to me.
tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"taking the el past york dauphin is not a move i’d recommend to tourists, even for steve’s. and i’m so sorry this happened to you. and not to victim blame, but in no world is a stranger using your shoulder as an arm rest “weird, but whatever.” that’s such an egregious violation of personal space. also…

that’s his test to see id you’re an easy target, and you passed it with flying colors. philly is a city where you have to be proactive about defending yourself - moving, confronting, making a scene if you have to. it’s an unfortunate reality. 

i’m so sorry this was your experience."

tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,people suck. does anyone remember the girl being raped on the train and no one doing absolutely anything? this is when you know most people really don’t care about others. actions speak louder than words.

long story short: fuck septa and fuck the cowards in this city who talk big but don't do shit in the face of injustice.

tu5ctp,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/tu5ctp/,"philadelphia is my home city, you just received a wake up call; you’re the only person reasonable for your safety. 

wearing headphones and being oblivious of your surroundings is a no no. if someone moves near you close enough to touch and rest on you, you need to move immediately. go to the conductor. 

at the minimum you should carry mace and practice pulling retrieving it in a emergency. 

i recommend taking a self defense class, learning bjj and muy thai. for residents of the united states if your serious about protecting yourself i’d say taking a concealed carry fire arms class and carry on the body not in your purse. 

this is the same advice i give to my family members. end of the day do as you please.


edit: food for thought, police are a reactionary force. they don’t stop crime, they go after criminals ie. someone who has already committed the crime."

once you feel ready for it, septa has a web form where you can submit concerns/complaints: http://www3.septa.org/customerservice/

i would absolutely make use of this form and let them know what happened and where.  i honestly have no idea if anything will come of it, but i know for a fact that nothing will if they don't know about it.  even if you're not ready to submit the form quite yet and relive it, jot down when and where it happened while the details are still fresh.

it sucks hot shit that these things happen and that it takes some amount of re-traumatizing yourself to make real the hope that anything will be done about it.  i know that can be incredibly demoralizing.  while i'm sure your guard will be up the whole time, i hope you are still able to find some joy in your trip here, despite how scary this place can be sometimes."

there is also the septa transit watch app that helps you surreptitiously report crimes in progress on septa property. each septa vehicle has the vehicle number somewhere inside, and that number can be used to pull up the security camera footage."

i heard the door close then open again for him to get out. 

then i straight started seeing stars...everything went white while this dude beat the fuck out of my face from behind. 

i pulled my knife to stab the guy and my gf at the time dove one to keep from me killing the guy. 

only one dude tried to help. i'll never forget everyone looking at me like it was deserved. 

the guy got jumped by police while getting off the bus. his excuse was ""he was talking bout my momma"". never met the dude before ever. pressed charges but nothing came of it. 

my face was fucked up for a few months and i'm glad my gf jumped to stop me from stabbing the dude. she got hit and i think that that was the only reason dude stopped punching me (from behind)"

no, joke, the murder rate here is on par with brazilian and south african cities.  other than mexican cities with drug cartel violence problems, there’s very few cities in the entire world with a higher homicide rate.

there have been many times i've walked past something without it really registering and then three blocks later i'm like, ""oh, wait, was that actually a domestic in the making?""

if you're not 90 or immunocompromised, you're probably fine. even more so if you got the vaccine. but there's still a portion of the population that needs to keep them to keep themselves or those close to them safe. when cases spike, city hall got worried because the rate of increase (as in how is the number of new cases per day changing) was high. whether or not that was a legit reason to immediately try to go full masks is up for debate, and i honestly don't have a strong opinion on it. but last i checked the numbers were roughly 1 in 10 were either elderly or immunocompromised (if that's wrong please put your source as a reply), and there's the occasional idiot who never bothered to get the vaccine and is coughing fucking everywhere. they're rare, but they put people on danger, and a mandate means that legally we can remove them from a situation where they were indoors and potentially harming that one in ten. if you have a vaccine or at least cover your damn cough and don't breathe down my neck, i couldn't care less whether you wear a mask or not. but you will find it to be a lot less black and white than your current stance. maybe i'm biased after seeing more than one family member in the hospital, i don't think id know if i was."

u6sd9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/u6sd9e/,"congress gave cdc wide power to enact policies to control the spread of disease. the crux of this case was whether requiring masks should be part of their ability to regulate sanitation. again, here's some of that astounding legal reasoning:

>the context of § 264(a) indicates that “sanitation” and “other measures” refer to measures that clean something, not ones that keep something clean.

i find it incredible that someone with this size brain was able to graduate from law school. she is arguing that masks, which are literally called ""sanitary face masks,"" have nothing to do with sanitation.

she finds requiring masks to be an overreach of this power, but the same power could be used to force daily sanitization of all surfaces inside private businesses, which would be an absurd burden, but clearly permitted by the law. 

if you read the full 59 page ruling, you'd see someone in over her depth, twisting dictionary definitions in contradicting ways to support a politically-motivated ruling. she did not make the right call, she took on the role of an activist judge and legislated from the bench. if congress didn't want the **centers for disease control and prevention** to have the power to enact sanitary measures as benign as requiring people to wear masks in order to *control and prevent the spread of disease*, congress should make that distinction explicit, not a judge.

the biden administration won't appeal it because everyone is over wearing masks and it would be political suicide. that's a shame because politics is the last thing that should be driving health policy amid a pandemic, regardless of how tired everyone is of it. i'm tired of it too. i travel a lot and i hate wearing masks for hours at a time through airports and on planes. but i got covid while traveling through airports in parts of the country where half the people ignored the mask mandates and the other half wore the masks under their noses or chins.

i'll tell you what i told the argumentative idiot above you. i never said that masks are ineffective or not helpful in reducing the spread of disease. all i ever said is that masks are not the sole reason why the op and many like them who say the same ignorant crap again and again didn't get sick over the past two years. masks only block two ways a disease can get in and not even that well depending on the type of mask. again, only a properly fitted n95/kn95 will give you as much protection as people act like all masks provide. 

assertions like that are dangerous and unhelpful. we need to press public health officials and our governments on much more effective policies than mask mandates. when you cheer this crap on, you are effectively setting us back further in this effort. politicians do this to appease you. to make it look like they are doing something. to make it so that the onus is on you and your ability to call out your peers instead of on them and their incompetence. you are simply making this harder for everyone on the ground that has been trying to push for more inclusive policies like universal sick leave and pressure on insurance companies to cover treatments and tests related to long covid symptoms. this is also making it less likely that there are studies for me to link you anyway. many of my colleagues won't touch mask studies with a ten foot pole. they are terrified of losing their job if they come up with a study that shows that masks or mask mandates aren't as effective as they were made out to be. it has become such a polarized, political, and moral issue that it has tainted the very science you claim to follow.

the second bus showed up on time. half way through, a man got on the bus. i think he had shit his pants prior to getting on the bus. no one stopped him from getting on and the bus driver wouldn't (couldn't? idk) kick him off. it was so bad that the bus driver kept opening the front and back door to try and air the bus out. this bus still had fabric seats.

1. like the guy mentions, for seniors, students and other groups, septa is already free. 

2. ""free"" is not free. people will be taxed, and already taxed for our system. i am definitely not opposed to more taxes going to the public transit system, but to just straight up refuse any revenue from riders seems silly/misguided.

3. people from the (wealthier)suburbs take septa too, will they be taxed, or will the city just be further subsidizing the 'burban lifestyle?

4.(this is the big one)like a lot of people mention here, it is not the cost that keep more people from riding. safety issues, dealing with upsetting situations, and simple convenience...this is why people avoid septa and choose to drive(the more expensive option). the priority should be to make septa more attractive for more people.

5. it has never made sense that people should have to pay to go to work, and demanding that big companies like penn and comcast take on a bigger burden of subsidizing the system by reimbursing employees' transit fees is a very good idea, one that is de rigor in places w/robust public transit systems like england and japan. philly is launching a trial period for public transit reimbursement right now(penn, jefferson, comcast). as a step for middle-class workers and lovers of public transit, i'd say this is a huge step in the right direction, with clear presedents. more of this, please."

after all, if transit is free, it becomes easier to dismiss complaints against it being bad.  i also fear that it might even more seem like a charity operation for the poor rather than a useful component of the transportation system, further justifying neglect and disinvestment.  this is exacerbated by the need for a greater subsidy, which might effectively not be an addition to transit budgets, but a diversion from other investments that might be made in it.

i think that many more people would be helped by making septa better than by making it free and suspect that the things are in some tension."
twwoz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/twwoz6/,i love this conceptually but septa's infrastructure is already shit enough without pulling one of the few foundations that's keeping it standing.
twwoz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/twwoz6/,"free fares are a terrible idea. i highly recommend [this piece by public transit guru alon levy](https://pedestrianobservations.com/2022/03/24/free-public-transport-why-now-of-all-times/)

it comes down to opportunity cost. to make fares free, you must necessarily lose money, or else take money allocated elsewhere. money that might be used for operations, or expanded service, or more frequent service, or accessibility improvements, or worker pay, and all the other things a transit agency does

now, there will always be tradeoffs in transit operations. more frequent buses mean better rider experience, but more wear and tear. running lines to remote locations might not provide a good roi, but might be a crucial lifeline for certain populations

so, is free fares a good trade off? well...not really. if you survey people about what the biggest issue they have with a certain transit agency, the answer is invariably ""the bus is too slow and doesn't reliably show up"". concern about fares is minimal, in the single digits. and that makes sense - the reason people don't take transit is ""it's slow and unreliable"". if there's one bus an hour that will take you to work, and that bus regularly runs late or doesn't show, you can't reliably get to work using the bus. a transit trip that costs $2.50 is such a minor expense that it does not factor in to decision-making for pretty much anybody

free fares does have some small advantages. you remove the need for fare gates, which reduces station expenses, and you allow faster and all door bus boarding, which speeds up buses a bit. but - these are pretty incidental improvements, and more importantly, you can get them using different payment systems. many systems worldwide use proof of payment. you buy a ticket/pass off board, and there are no fare gates. but there are roving inspectors who will randomly check people to see if they have their ticket. now, this system does have issues, particularly in the american context of racial disparities in policing, but the point is that gateless boarding does not require free fares

furthermore, this specific proposal is even worse because it relies on a pool of pandemic money. septa relies on ticket revenue for a significant portion of its budget. by going fareless, septa would essentially be betting the future on continued state and federal subsidies for its operations. which effectively is betting that the democrats will remain in power in both harrisburg and washington, and/or that the republican party will suddenly reverse course from its hostility to public transit. it's not a bet i would make

so, what happens if septa goes fareless, and loses subsidy money from washington and/or harrisburg? well...the budget has to be cut somewhere. workers will be laid off, fleets retired, some routes will be eliminated, others will lose frequency, maintenance and cleaning will be less frequent or deferred, and new investments will be cancelled. which will result in worse transit that fewer people use. and then when septa goes hat in hand to ask for more money, detractors can point to declining ridership as a reason to keep cutting subsidies. which further results in reduced ridership. we're looking at a death cycle here!

regional rail fare structures should be reformed - the commuter model of ""daily commuters have their monthly passes subsidized by their employers"" is not going to survive the pandemic, and a round trip cost of up to $20 in some places is legitimately a barrier to people taking the train (though worse is infrequency). but free fares is basically saying ""i want to have worse transit that doesn't cost $2.50 per trip"", and requires a bet that the gop will never get back into power on top of it"
twwoz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/twwoz6/,"if organized transit and sustainability advocates truly want to fix septa, they can’t view it as an extra amenity or luxury for the white, affluent, or few. they must accept that it’s a major economic asset and a life-and-death necessity for its majority black, working-class, and   
low-wealth ridership – that septa relies on for its own survival, too.""

bs. black/latino/white riders want the same - safe, clean and on-time ride.   septa ceo should personally ride the trains every day, checking that the police on their payroll are actively patrolling (hint: they are not), that doors and passages are open and clearly marked (they are not) and that crime and human neglect  don't deter riders (they do)."
twwoz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/twwoz6/,"> septa, instead, gets increasingly worse as the pandemic fog clears: a wobbly septic tank of unsafe systems and trash-, smoke-, needle-riddled spaces, along with a labyrinth of clunky payment systems meant to frustrate its core ridership of low-wealth riders, and an out-of-touch board that barely rides it.

> having a mass transit system with so much potential, and – as bad as it’s been – so beloved and relied upon by so many generations (including myself), we’d think that every effort would be made to revive it. so, just make riding septa free.

so the argument is, septa is bad, so we should make it free, because that will somehow make it better?"

the main reason people don't feel ride septa is the shithead to regular passenger ratio is way out of whack. there's already way too many shitheads on septa as it is. 

this past monday i thought i was gonna get into a fight on the bus because some shithead was blasting some sports podcast over his bluetooth speaker. when i got to the back door to get off my stop i made direct eye contact with this motherfucker for almost a minute straight pretty much begging him to say something 2 and he didn't. he was actually the first one to break eye contact because he probably knew i was chomping at the bit to curse him the fuck out for blasting his podcast for the whole bus to hear and he must have known that he was in the wrong. 

i'm not even a tough guy or fighter, but shit like that irks me more than anything else. i'm used to people blasting music directly from their phones, this is philly after all, but this was beyond the pale. 

it was a fucking sports podcast, blaring through the bus on a **bluetooth speaker**.

people have to do a better job of raising their kids in this city. 

people blasting music directly from their devices is not something that should be normalized, and too many people look the other way and allow this shit to continue to the point that this shithead felt comfortable enough to blast a podcast from a bluetooth speaker on the bus. 

i just can't get into the number of reasons why this is a bad idea.

septa is already de facto homeless housing in the city, this would only make the open drug use and urine and feces problem ever present at septa stations even worst. 

all these progressive policies do is damage the working class, people like me who are just trying 2 go 2 work and come home and have to deal with way 2 many dickheads along the way.

how someone isn't using headphones in 2022 and choosing to jam out on public transportation like it's their private vehicle is beyond me. i think a lot of these people know what they are doing is rly fucked up and blasting their music on public transportation is their way of asserting dominance in a shared public space, in a sense baiting other people on the bus/train into getting into a fight with them. 

like i'm sure i wasn't the only one bothered by that dickhead on the bus the other day, and it's not like he turned down his podcast after breaking eye-contact, he probably just went right along his merry way, bothering the rest of the people on there until he reached his stop. 

if anything, if there was a better quality of septa, that charged $3.00 a ride and kept all the homeless, people that don't pay and enforced some actual rules like: ""don't blast music directly from your device"", i would opt for that service every time even though it would be 50% more expensive than septa and i think many other people would as well."

twwoz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/twwoz6/,"yeah, pretty much, which is actually a really good argument.

a number of people don't ride for a variety of reasons, with cost being one of them. if you could hop on a bus for free to get from, say, center city to roxborough, you may be more likely to do it than drive. 

additionally, with more demand for service due to the number of people getting on the bus and subway, it would ideally increase the rate of service itself. bus lines that run once an hour may increase to every 30 minutes, bus lines running every 15 down to 10, etc, etc... this would help reduce the number of people driving overall, too, which would be a big plus.

throw in more rail service thanks to increased demand and making it free, and you've effectively made a better overall system. you get people who would be more likely to come into the city since its free to get in and leave without having to pay for gas or parking. you get more middle-class people coming in to shop. you're giving more access to jobs so people can take home more cash.

that said, all of this is idealized and aspirational. it's likely there will be new problems, and while there are massive benefits getting there won't be easy and will take years.

overall, though, the thesis of ""we need more middle-class folks to take septa again to clean it up"" has a sound basis in the pre-2020 world. while not perfect, septa was a lot cleaner and safer when more people were taking it overall because the middle-class and higher-class riders provided a balance."

if septa's budget is $1b, and 300m of that came from fares, by going fareless you're saying ""i want septa to operate on $700m now""

where do you find $300m in savings in the system? **cuts**

you have to reduce service frequency (run buses once an hour instead of every 30 minutes saves 50% of operating costs for that line), close down low ridership lines (an unprofitable line could be subsidized by the profitable ones, but we have a shortfall to make up now!), defer maintenance, lay off employees

but let's say that septa is getting $300m from the federal government, so septa's budget will remain the same. surely that fixes the problem, right!

well...there's an opportunity cost here. without fares, but with our shiny federal subsidy, septa can operate...exactly as before. remember, the budget is still just $1b - it has to operate exactly as it did before. all of that federal subsidy is simply going to maintaining existing service, to filling the budget hole that removing fares created

alternatively, we could take that $300m federal subsidy and use that *on top of fares*. increase cleaning and security at high issue stations. run more frequent buses and trains. invest in upgraded bus stations. maybe even put money towards a major new project, like the roosevelt boulevard extension. every dollar you spend on free fares is a dollar you aren't spending on better service. oh, and what happens in 2022 when the republicans retake the house and cancel that subsidy?

is it worth it?"

i agree with you on the aspirational ideas too, but the whole thing falls flat on its face once you begin to talk about where the resources for running extra service, cleaning more frequently, staffing/policing stations longer hours, etc will come from. it's a crying shame that charles ellison, who runs a pr firm in his spare time, doesn't include any of that analysis in his opinion piece."

right now, septa doesn't seem to have any reason to improve since they're the primary public transit system for so many people. people aren't gonna boycott septa anytime soon. and the investors and board of septa still prioritize making a return on their investments rather than the philanthropic goal of having a safe and reliable public transit system for the populace."

i honestly can't answer that. i don't think there is a black-and-white cutoff and it certainly depends on a lot of factors, but i would expect that once you have a significant enough number of middle class, white-collar people using public transit then that will create enough public pressure for improvements. i use ""affluent"" as a relative term here.

&#x200b;

>also when would a car reach the point where it is a less attractive option aside from cost of operation?

when it is no longer the most convenient option 99% of the time. right now our infrastructure is designed such that usually the only viable way to get somewhere is a car. to change that, space and priority needs to be taken away from cars and given to other more efficient forms of transit like buses, trams, and cycling.

this would take the form of dedicated transit lanes and tram lines, protected bike lanes, and intersection signals which give priority for these other modes. this creates a pressure for people to use the other forms of transit because they will be much faster than cars and over time encourage further and accelerating investment.

&#x200b;

>before the car, virtually all trains ran at the same speed. when cars   
were introduced is when we started seeing options in varying degrees of   
train types and speeds, because they had to compete.

i would want to see the evidence that competition with cars had anything to do with the improvement in speed in trains, rather than just the development of new technologies. there are european countries which have many very fast and convenient trains, even in places where car usage has been reduced drastically.

&#x200b;

>seeing as septa is the only public transportation option in the area,   
why would they cater to pressure from more affluent riders when they   
don't do anything currently even with competition from superior modes of transportation?

because right now the people who use septa are the people who are likely going to use it no matter how superior other modes are, because they can't afford to or otherwise aren't able to use those modes. additionally, the current ridership generally doesn't have the political influence to create pressure on septa leadership to make changes. both of those would change if cars are de-prioritized.

while that's certainly the case in some instances, that's not true all the time. for example, nyc just recently ordered a bunch of electric buses from new flyer and proterra, definitely not names we think of when it comes to auto manufacturers.

> their income is guaranteed whether i buy a car or take the bus.

i'm really not sure this is the case either. public transit vehicles generally have longer life spans, are maintained more regularly, and are more efficient, meaning less vehicles need to be bought. i can't say i've looked into this extensively before so i'm not 100% sure, but on its face it seems illogical.

agreed, which would make a nationwide train system tough. in regions where that density exists, though - the northeast, up and down california, houston to los angeles, etc. - trains could actually do a lot of good in replacing short haul flights which really wreak havoc environmentally. that's besides the point, though, cause we're talking about philly where that density obviously exists"

the cities were designed around horses, carts, and foot traffic.  there was no 76 or 95 and there was no subway, and penn campus was farmland when center city was mature.  

japan is made of islands and is really tiny compared to population.  there was no area to expand to if people want to move out of densely populated cities.  

we have suburbs.  most places in the usa if you want to buy groceries you have to make a car trip.  it wasn't like that in 1907, before the model t.

people left the cities (for, reasons...) and moved to developments in the suburbs that were only accessible by car -- by design.  because they commute into the city they demand infrastructure to accommodate their cars.  

when people are in cars they forget what it is like to be a pedestrian and get insular and annoyed at everyone else.  (it doesn't help that they are usually going to or from work when they are driving.)

  lack of empathy and need for convenience and growing up without understanding that you can actually walk to get groceries makes people *not even realize not driving is an option*.  so they demand more infrastructure.  commutes get longer because of traffic so they build highways, which immediately run at capacity because you can't build your way out of traffic (as soon as you make a new lane people use it who wouldn't if it wasn't there).

this has been occurring even as use of cars has proliferated, not because they were forced to become less attractive as an option for transportation. the data available indicates this.

my claim that septa won't get better is because of their track record. the city has tried these solutions before multiple times. service is virtually the same and commute times and ridership have barely improved. the return on investment has been marginal. just because other cities with better run transit systems have ideas that work for their specific challenges do not mean they will necessarily work here. it is naive to claim there is some universal solution such as changing infrastructure to cater towards buses and trains. throwing bus lanes everywhere won't work when septa themselves claim they won't use them. i have even provided a source.

it would actually be easier and more cost effective to probably scrap septa entirely and rebuild our public transit system from the ground up, than continually throwing money and resources at them when all they have proven to do is waste it. positive thinking is not going to magically change how poorly run they are, just as giving a drug addict money and then simply expecting him to spend it on something other than drugs without addressing the underlying cause."

i only spent 4 most there. i hated sf.

now i'm back in nyc. i lived here 2001-13. it seems to be the same. but post covid has seen an increase in housing for the homeless here.

really, *really* tough to do when you're combating mass poverty, and trying to make sure you have enough to eat. this was a problem caused from the top down, the solution needs to come - at least mostly - from the top down, and anything less than that is just abandoning responsibility.

i also know that poverty has been declining, and reached a record low in 2019, but that coincided with a trend of increasing violent crime in several cities. in fact, the crime rate in philadelphia fell after the 2008 recession created a huge amount of poverty, but started to rise again in 2015 as the poverty rate was falling. what gives?

it's possible that it's something else societally. choices being made, policies, cultural changes. i don't know. i'm tired of seeing poverty used as a virtual excuse. overlay poverty trends with violent crime in philadelphia. the poverty rate was the lowest in two decades in 2018 and 2019, but the murder rate was higher than 2011 and 2012 when the poverty rate was at its highest.

txmih4,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/txmih4/,"it’s clear that you don’t understand. no one is saying these parents are trying to be bad. it’s just that after decades of being stuck in poverty (as another user here with views similar to you said), they don’t know how to be a good parent. parenting is a difficult task and not easy to “automatically get better at” like you’re assuming, even if you’re not in a poor household. let’s take these poor parents as an example. they’re not simply going to push more for their kids to attend medical school just because they are no longer in poverty. their kids aren’t going to suddenly value education more over hip hop or acting like an idiot in the streets just because their mom and dad moved them into a less impoverished neighborhoods. your assumptions that all parents are created equal is pretty off mark. even if it’s not necessarily the direct fault of the parents themselves, it doesn’t mean the problem isn’t there. 

i’ll say it again for the last time. just as anything else in politics and society, these problems are never as one sided and as clear cut you make it out to be. there is no single clear cut “silver bullet” solution, and you’ll just fail to garner the support you need to actually remedy the situation."

i don't think i've said that we ignore accountability. i'm putting crime into the broader socioeconomic context. people commit crime for reason; i don't believe people are born criminals. it's important to understand the reasons first before you can start reducing crime."

some of us have the ability to think beyond the immediate and care about both short and long term consequences. it's clear that you simply do not want to commit any resources to poor non-white communities, ever, and you want to pretend that there are good excuses for that. there aren't."

a few weeks ago i took my family in to the city for some sight-seeing. the kids wanted to see the liberty bell and independence hall, etc. we had so much more trouble just with basic operation and navigation than i ever remember having. 

why don't they have kiosks at the regional rail stations to buy boarding passes? they have those machines in center city, so i know they exist. also, why are these boarding-pass kiosk machines so slow and difficult to understand? i wanted to buy a few day passes for myself and my family, and the user interface was not intuitive at all.

those weird security fences/gates they have set up in the center city stations are super inconvenient. once you go in, you can't get back out even to buy a coffee without causing problems or possibly getting double-charged? 

and on the return trip, we were trying to get into the suburban station from surface level, and we couldn't figure out how to do it. doors we found were locked, signs were pointing us all over the place. we started at redding terminal market, followed signs, tried every set of septa doors we saw (all were locked, with signs to use a different entrance) and finally ended up at the suburban station entrance on 16th street. that's a hell of a walk when we were literally on top of a station when we started.

i used to say ""yeah it's easy to get into the city and go wherever we want to go on septa"". now i don't think i would take septa into the city, especially not if i have kids along. it's too much of a headache, and i didn't even see any of the drugs/needles or anything like this post mentioned. for similar price, and significantly less hassle, it's easier to just drive and park."

start arresting for open drug use, vagrants, smoking, turnstile jumping, along with pissing and shitting. start cleaning up in, on, and around all septa stations, especially the el. 

there can be no tolerance for open air drug scenes on public transit or in public spaces. otherwise the current situation is what you get, and it's only going to get worse without enforcement."
toruo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/toruo9/,"> which equates to septa telling everyone who depends on them to go fuck themselves, while those who don't depend on them will use alternatives rather than put up with the atrocious conditions.

septa is in a tough spot, its high income users stick to regional rail--but are utilizing septa's services less since they're primarily working from home rather than commuting into center city. meanwhile, folks using the el to reach 69th street for busses or the hsl to work in kitchens, residential care facilities, or similar service jobs aren't going to stop using drugs until their living situations improve.

yep. my experience has been more pleasant since i've been reverse commuting since june (and regularly taking transit on weekends/after work) than before the pandemic.

>and i saw a while back a comment where you mentioned that the bsl is nicer than it was pre-covid and a lot of the complaints about the el were likely ""doomposting"" by people who don't live in the city.

this is objectively true. it in no way invalidates everyone's experience, but my time on the el (a couple of times a week, mostly in cc but a few times a month out to 69th st or frankford transportation center) has been about the same. 

*there are absolutely people nodding the fuck out and taking up the front vestibule while doing so - there's absolutely no way to deny that.*

that being said, that was absolutely my experience prior to covid and in my experience it's at about the same frequency as before.

>more than one person was smoking
>money was exchanged for drugs
>the buyer of said drugs prepared and did the drugs. yes, this includes heating the heroin in tin foil over a lighter

toruo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/toruo9/,">cleaning up the needles, helping those that need help

broken windows policing doesn't mean that homeless people are compassionately directed to housing and services-- it means that they are arrested for loitering.  everybody wants the needles gone, but broken windows policing is a policy of *criminalizing* quality of life issues, using law enforcement to crack down on people.  it's also not really about the quality of life issues in and of themselves, the end goal is not clean and pleasant subways, it is at its heart a strategy for reducing major crimes that is based on a theory of criminal psychology.

broken windows policing, such as was most famously employed in nyc, is associated with higher rates of police brutality and the deterioration of community relations with police.  if your goal is to ""help those that need help"" i don't think that you really wish to associate yourself with the broken windows set.

bsl is ok, it’s somewhat cleaner than the mfl and i haven’t had any major issues on it, but i don’t take it regularly. it’s less crowded ive noticed and i don’t like that after dark, it feels a bit isolating. the mfl is a different story though. i won’t take the mfl alone anymore. i used to have to go to kensington and frankford somewhat often for work and i’ve seen so much open drug use (shooting and snorting heroin/fentanyl, smoking crack, smoking weed and cigarettes), a dude masturbating, fights, spilled drinks and food, human waste in stations and trains, a guy taking a shit at k&a, panhandling, and almost got mugged at 30th st. station (a guy lunged at me as i was coming up the stairs but a large older man coming behind me scared him off, came to the station 30 minutes later and cops were looking for him because he actually had mugged and robbed someone)."

i'm not trying to be a dick here but is septa police underfunded/understaffed/or in idgaf mode?

thxf23,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/thxf23/,i wish it could be that cheap for regional rail. $5.75 each way (zone 3) and i only go in about 3 days a week so it's not even worth it to get the weekly or monthly passes
thxf23,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/thxf23/,"considering that septa can’t afford to pay new drivers (thus not being able to meet their scheduled service levels), purchase new equipment, perform maintenance on row or infrastructure in general, expand service to areas of need, do basic cleaning of their equipment, or keep the system relatively clean or safe… i think the cutting fares thing is a silly discussion.

ideally it should be free (or much cheaper) and the city, surrounding counties and state should subsidize the cost. but that’s not realistic. it’s bad enough that the state legislature has tried to kill public transit for years, but the surrounding suburbs don’t pay their fair share either. it’s a joke how septa is funded. it’s also a joke how it has been run in the past too.

also, transpasses are not designed for somebody who takes the subway to and from on weekdays only. that’s what the travel wallet is for. trail passes are different and a great deal.

septa needs to figure out how to do some amazing pr to get people back though, because currently it’s not ideal for anybody to take public transit if they have alternatives. it’s dirty, unreliable and at times, not all that safe. that photo is what seats on busses tend to look like in the morning, as in, first run out of the garage. it’s rare to see seats that don’t look like that. plus, these are the plastic seats that shouldn’t be that hard to keep clean, not the cloth ones. https://i.imgur.com/v3l8nbp.jpg"

thxf23,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/thxf23/,"i don't quite understand your argument. while i think septa's products are set up kind of dumb, they are very commuter-friendly. someone who takes septa 5 days a week \*only\* for commuting is not purchasing a weekly transpass because they've made that same calculation you did. they probably just re-load a key. the monthly and annual passes are better deals for people who commute and use it for things aside from commuting (and can afford it upfront). and like other people have said, philly's transit costs are some of the lowest compared to bigger/peer cities.

i think bigger issues are 1) how annoying it is to quickly purchase and load a key from the kiosks, which never fucking work and are slow as hell when they do and 2) the fare products are marketed so poorly. there should be a simple but informative chart on the website and next to every kiosk at every station of the different products that says something like this:

>""just visiting for the weekend? buy a 3-day convenience pass! $18, good for up to 24 one-way trips. here for a bit longer? maybe you need a weekly pass!""

and blah blah so on. that way people can make a quick, informed decision about what to buy for their needs instead of trying to make calculations in their head.

we need to stop thinking of public transit only in terms of commute trips anyway. people use transit to get to healthcare appointments, school, shopping, kid pickup, etc. especially now as many white-collar workers are no longer working in cc. if public transit is seen as safe, reliable, and easy to use, people other than commuters will use it and agencies won't be as decimated by the loss of traditional commuting due to remote work, economic downturn, etc."

thxf23,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/thxf23/,"the idea is that you’ll be riding more than 2-3 times per day with the weekly pass, thereby saving money. yes, you need basic math calculations to figure that out so some of the population won’t realize they’re saving money, but if i ride 2 times every day of the week (let’s say i go somewhere via septa saturday and sunday), that’s $2 * 2 times * 7 days = $28. i would be saving money already if i buy the weekly pass. it would definitely be nice and a super deal if the weekly pass costed less though.

5 days a week with 2 trips is $20.

7 days a week with 2 trips is $28.

the weekly pass works for 7 days and is $25.50.

if you stay home, walk/bike, or go somewhere you don’t need public transportation on the weekends, you spend less by using the travel wallet. if you go out and need public transportation on the weekends, you spend less by using the weekly pass. at least, i believe that’s the case.

if you’re only going to many places on a particular day, i believe the one-day convenience pass or something is a better deal."

the weekly/monthly cost shouldn’t work out to be nearly even with pay as you go, it should be a discount that is good enough to be a “no brainer.”

that being said, the “profitability” of running a full bus at lower fares has to be better than running an empty bus at higher fares.

the bus lines are arbitrary. it’s just true. the subway lines are unfinished, and as a result, not really useful. the regional rail lines are great but infrequent. the highways are constantly under construction and congested. parking sucks, the ppa don’t help at all. biking is dangerous and tedious cause the streets are a mess. 

the city wasn’t planned to begin with, and the subsequent additions have outgrown the mold. we can only grow up. 

if you want any of this to change, the powers that be in the city have to seriously consider restricting vehicular travel into the city, first. it would allow a wealth of other options to grow as a result of people needing to commute by other methods. 

less car traffic would allow septa to create lines that would, for example, use something like pareto to optimize routes in the city. more competent riders on the subs would disincentivize people from shooting up on the train. more ridership would provide better funding and would subsequently create a dynamic for cleaning the trains better, for example.

thxf23,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/thxf23/,"ok.

so.

we already collect taxes for septa from all tax payers.

and we can assume we can collect more “taxes” from previous regular riders. (one way to look at this is septa already was free but there was tax collection at the point of use.)

low income, working class, and lower middle class are all subsidized already in various ways. some middle class and upper middle class and above are already riders and we are assuming that we can collect about the same amount of revenue from them.

who is left?"
thxf23,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/thxf23/,"yes, of course we can look at the transaction as a ""point of use"" tax, but when that transaction disappears, that tax will have to come from elsewhere.

if not, that's awesome.  who would be against free transit with no increases in taxes to pay for it?  

if so, which is the more likely case, the problem will be convincing people of the priority of free transit programs over other issues in the city (many of which are dire, and it would be a strange morality indeed that eschewed them in favor of free transit) that the increase in taxes could go to.

the only other option would be not increasing taxes, but pulling them from other city services.  then to have that conversation, we'd need to know which ones so we could see if they are indeed superfluous and unnecessary, and so can be sacrificed, or if they are also important, in which case we'd have to figure out if they can be cut for the sake of free transit.

first off your language continually seems to indicate that you forget that 100% of tax payers in this situation already pay taxes that go to septa. 

but that’s just an aside.

so we’ve agreed that a very very large percentage of tax payers already pay extra “taxes” as a user point of purchase tax, and that an additional and very large portion of the tax payers group are already exempt. so what tax payers are left? it’s not a rhetorical question because we’ve yet to label those who are left."
thxf23,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/thxf23/,"no it doesn't.  it seems to indicate that i'm worried *any more taxes than those already existing* will be problematic.  

and we haven't agreed a ""very very large percentage"" of people pay a point of purchase ""tax"" at septa.  i've said we *don't have enough* of that, and so operations need tax money from harrisburg *because of this* already.

we haven't talked, let alone agreed, on any kind of exemption in this conversation.

you are trying to say ""here look, you won't notice the increase in taxes because it will be equivalent to what you paid for in transit costs, so you break even"" which is obvious.  the problem is that you can't specifically target just septa riders, so people who do not ride septa *will notice* that increase in taxes.  

it isn't me who is leaving anyone out, it is you who are assuming we have such a huge population of riders that to increase taxes to make it free would be no big deal.  if septa was breaking even, or wasn't cutting routes left and right due to lack of ridership, i'd believe you.  but that's not the case."

thxf23,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/thxf23/,"ok. there’s 10 upper and uber wealthy people involved. 3 of them have been paying a point of purchase tax into the system. let’s say septa gets 30 dollars out of every hundred they need from these 3 people. if you spread that out amongst the remaining upper and uber wealthy tax bracket the original 3 will pay less than their original point of purchase tax, and the 7 other upper and wealthy will pay a relatively tiny amount to generate the same amount of money. that’s in incredibly general terms. so for the vast majority of tax payers it stays the same or goes down for a small number of people in the upper and uber wealthy sections it goes up a small amount.

i’ll give you a more concrete but still pretty general example. my father makes 500,000 a year, his sister makes 200,000 a year, his brother makes 75,000 a year. my father and aunt never ride septa. my uncle has a monthly pass and spends 1,000 a year. my uncle would now pay nothing. my aunt would pay 250 dollars into the system. my father would pay 750 dollars."

yup, or trolleys. i am convinced that the presence of a driver discourages people from acting out of line. it's rarely a rational calculation that leads someone to beat up a random person on the subway, and the subconscious sense that you're likely to be noticed by an authority figure is enough to deter most impulsive bullshit.

on trains, just having somebody in charge patrolling the cars and stations would create the sense that someone is looking, and prevent a lot of this stuff.

in this individual case, looks like it was a robbery, so in that case the perp probably *did* make a more rational calculation of when to strike. but for cases of stupid teenagers goading each other into violence, that's not how these things go."
u3tbcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/u3tbcl/,mandatory foot patrols in general. walking the beat is basically non-existent these days. cops would much rather sit in their climate controlled vehicles.
u3tbcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/u3tbcl/,"summer 2020, a lady was driving home from work late at night with her teenaged nephew and toddler daughter in the car. she drove into a section of 52nd st. that was blocked off by cops after some looting followed by a protest coming through. they took it upon themselves to stop the car, pull her out, beat her both her and her nephew, and kidnap the baby girl.

they then tweeted a photo of said girl being held by an officer with text saying that she'd been found wandering alone during a riot and the nice cops took her in. it was obviously a complete lie and was proved so by some video footage that surfaced not long after. the mom was separated from her daughter for at least several hours. once the lie was revealed, they took down the copaganda twitter post.

the mom eventually won a civil suit against the police department, paid for (of course) by your and my tax dollars. i have no idea if any of the guilty cops were ever disciplined, let alone fired, let alone charged with crimes."

septa has admitted it's got a long way to go with the basics of communication and real-time information like this. i know that they tried with the app, but... yeah. it leaves a lot to be desired.

septa does have some very helpful folks at the septa\_social account on twitter, if you use twitter. it's not 24 hours and not instant, but they're pretty responsive to general questions and very friendly."

i generally don't trust the app, it's quite prone to tell me ""the train is rolling up"" when there is no train. with the bsl and el, i don't care because they run pretty frequently but when there's a train every half hour or hour it's kind of a pain in the ass getting gaslit by an app."

only use the app for a general gist of scheduling. never trust the septa app with exact times, correct detours (bus), or to correctly report delays or if a train is planning to skip a stop from being too full. when you get to the regional rail station, read every sign in person. they will tell you the line and direction it’s going or in-bound/outbound depending which station you’re having issues with, and are usually pretty accurate with delays. when i’m doing ask any nice looking person on the platform or even the conductor when the train pulls up (haven’t taken septa recently, with key i’m not sure if they still have conductors for paper tickets and cash?). i’ve never had issues asking or giving random people directions when needed.

sd96kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/sd96kl/,"given my extensive experience jumping turnstiles(this incident) my take is that it's riskier in philly because you're liable to end up stuck on the platform for 15 minutes most of the time.  always know your exits!

with septa there's only one line beyond any given turnstile so you're likely going to be hanging out for awhile waiting to get arrested.

nyc subways or at least the major stations have multiple trains rolling in and out constantly with all the different lines.  maybe it's not the train you want, but if you see someone coming to arrest you there's an exit."

that is likely true, but i would like to know how performance correlates with risk of losing your job.  if your effort directly correlated to your continued employment, it would stand that you'd put forth more effort.  

i wonder if more pay for septa workers would be wasted.  more money is good, but why would it motivate better performance, if there was no risk of losing your job.  more pay is just icing on the cake.  

it's the same with many non-merit based jobs.  if you get x more in your paycheck once you reach x years, regardless of your responsibilities or performance, why try harder than the next guy?

i do wonder."

i’m spitballing here, but maybe septa tries a top-down or single-point approach, like using a single gps tracker on each train/bus. that leaves one critical point, and if that tracker fails, then the location is wrong. the google maps approach allows for some wiggle-room because it has so many more location points.

sd96kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/sd96kl/,"so, basically, this “gift exchange” payment wouldn’t apply if poor performance was tied to losing your job. the point here is that workers who could easily get by with doing less work tend to actually do more work when they’re paid more. that is, they don’t *need* to do work harder, yet they do so anyway. 

the hypothesized reason is that the employer is “gifting” a higher wage to the employee, and the employee wants to reciprocate the gift by working harder. (reciprocation is found in a lot of areas/contexts, so it’s not unreasonable to see it happen here.) 

the original empirical study was done using data of women who worked a menial task (something like stuffing envelopes, but i forget exactly) in america during wwii. since then, it’s been seen in tons of other contexts.

so ... why does this work?  is it because they see the higher pay (as a gift) as not being proportional to their effort, and that triggers some kind of altruism that makes them work harder?

or maybe it comes from just feeling more appreciated.  ""you can get more with honey than you can with vinegar"" kind of thing?

either way ... it's kind of mind blowing.

sd96kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/sd96kl/,"“counterintuitive” is the word you’re looking for, i think, and you’re exactly right. this was one of a handful of papers that were really the beginning of what we now call behavioral economics. they completely flipped the norm for what we now call “neoclassical economics” predicted in these scenarios. it’s pretty wild, and it’s a large part of what inspired me to go into economics. 

as to why it works, that’s hard to pin down, though there’s been a lot of research into it in the last 40 years. as a general rule, most economists don’t really believe in “altruism,” at least in a strict sense. rather, economists would say that someone gets internal personal enjoyment (“utility”) from helping others (as well as other possible benefits, like social recognition or whatever). we refer to this internal utility that comes from helping others as “warm glow.” and yes, it’s definitely possible/probable that warm glow plays at least some role in this scenario. 

other possible explanations could be things like an innate sense of trust. we observe a similar “overpayment” compared to the neoclassical prediction in so-called “trust games” (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2c39&q=trust+games&btng=). basically, person a is given $10 and allowed to split it between keeping and giving. the amount given is then tripled, at which point person b gets to decide how much to keep and how much to return to person a. as you can guess, the neoclassical prediction is that person a keeps the entire $10, and if person a does decide to give anything (which is not predicted, but still must be accounted for as a possibility), then person b keeps everything given/tripled. however, this is actually pretty rare. people tend to give, which is seen as “trusting” behavior, and players b tend to return some money, which is seen as “trustworthy” behavior. it’s kind of wild, but that’s now even turned into spin-off “investment games” and even a version where they give subjects an intranasal dose of oxytocin (the chemical released in our brains to make us more trusting) to see if that increases trusting behavior (it does). explanations vary from social cues, expectations that players would want things to go their way if the roles were reversed, and even hypotheses related to evolutionary biology (i think gary becker wrote on this). 

so we can kind of extrapolate or consider these sorts of explanations in our gift exchange labor contract space, too. perhaps there’s some evolutionary advantage to this sort of setup. (maybe foragers who gather 20 extra berries in a village of 10 people put in 20 extra berries worth of effort to only get 2 more berries for themself, but that is a desirable trait from the group perspective in that it increases the likelihood of village survival. i’m just spitballing here.) or perhaps we have some sort of social/cultural desire to give back to those who give things to us. (and if so, that could also be due to an evolutionary pressure, fwiw.) 

we could probably write a pretty big list here, to be honest, and in the end it’s probably a combination of multiple causes, and all of that is also probably very context dependent. some people might never exhibit this behavior, or some might always exhibit it, but i expect that most people are somewhere in the middle. depending on the context (and a ton of other variables at play), we may or may not exhibit it, and the degree to which we exhibit it probably varies there too. 

it’s awesome stuff. it’s totally unexpected, yet kind of simple, but then also very complex."

she’s now petrified of riding, won’t ride alone, and is looking into non-el ways of commuting to work (bike, car, bus, etc.) since it’s not a viable long-term solution to have her boyfriend commute with her."

ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,"we need more security at the stations and on the trains themselves. with there being a rape on the train during the middle of the day, it makes me wonder if anyone else was on that same cart. but, your point is irrelevant because it comes down to the fact that this violent culture has only grown in this past generation. point fingers at the da, city government, music, influencers, even social media. these animals are out of control"

ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,"i hope the assailant was on camera. the idea with mandatory 4k is that they would then be tracked through the system, and followed in near real time, right after the attack was reported. then they could be followed out of the system using city cameras and tracked above ground.  if mandatory 4k was in effect, this person would already be arrested or under direct surveillance, waiting for le to get them in custody."

ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,i was attacked on on the el in the middle of the day in center city on a car with over 20 people on it.  doesn’t matter.
ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,people took video of the assault happening tho. there were people right there. i don’t know how someone didn’t do anything to help.
ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,"businesses have to pay to administer the program through wageworks or similar, so there is a cost. for larger businesses that have a lot of opt in, they can likely save more money on payroll taxes, but for a smaller business with low opt in, it could be an unwelcome cost burden."
ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,"i hate to say it, but even if there were others on the train, would anybody have done anything? we've heard about incidents on septa and people are just too scared or desensitized to get involved."

ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,"> they would then be tracked through the system, and followed in near real time

couldn't you do that with normal cameras though?  and wouldn't the solution be more (working) cameras in any resolution?"

ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,"lots of people think they’d intervene if they saw something, and some maybe even would…if others made the first move.  

but no one is looking to get shot, and this is a city where it’s not crazy to think that you might get shot if you step into some shit, cuz there’s a lot of crazy in this town, and a lot of guns. 

so the most common reaction is just keep your head down and hope you get left out of it.  at best, someone may try to film it thinking it’ll at least be helpful catching the person after the fact.

and i think the depressing thing is, that’ll hold true if there’s 3 people on the car, or 30 people on the car. 

everywhere and always, you’re on your own."
ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,really? what can the average person do unless they’re specifically trained to deal with such a thing? i’ve been assaulted before so i know it’s awful but i’m not putting my life at risk unless it’s necessary. bc then not only will he hurt me he’ll likely take it out on the victim bc that’s what these fucks do
ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,if you have 50 employees you are already paying someone to handle payroll and benefits. this is not an added cost. it does not require an additional employee.

ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,"that is why there is an emergency button to call security. the very unfortunate sexual assault incident a bit ago on the el at 69th st. was not seen by others, despite the media initially reporting so. however, i'm not gonna put it past people nowadays when people would much rather film fights and tragic events, rather than report it."
ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,yup.  i was attacked in an el car with at least 20 other people in it.  only one person tried to help and she backed off when it was clear they would hurt her too.

ub7pia,https://www.reddit.com/r/philadelphia/comments/ub7pia/,this is my point. im a small ass woman i can’t even fight another women let alone an assailant. i can call 911 and that’s it. last time one of these incidences were posted a lot of people including my mother said anybody who didn’t actively (aka not just calling 911) try to stop the assault was a piece of shit.
